ðŸŽ¡ The Wheel of Lunch
Tired of the endless "What's for lunch?" debate? The Wheel of Lunch is a fun, interactive lunch picker designed to make your decision-making effortless and exciting!

Spin it yourself here: https://neilschreiner.github.io/TheWheelOfLunch/

How It Works
Zip Code Power: Enter your zip code, and the wheel dynamically loads up to five popular, open lunch spots nearby. Not enough options? We'll fill the rest with generic picks to keep the fun rolling!

Automatic Spin: Watch as the wheel automatically spins for 8 seconds, building anticipation.

Instant Result: A "Congratulations!" box pops up, revealing your chosen restaurant.

Google Maps Ready: Find your way easily with a "View on Google Maps" button that opens directions in a new tab.

Spin Again: Want another go? Hit "Spin Again" to restart.
